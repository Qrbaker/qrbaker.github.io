Check out the prologue here!
Clouds can be light and fluffy. They can also be&amp;hellip; not.
One massive convenience (and source of lock in) offered by major tech players is Cloud Storage. Its a big deal because its (relatively) easy to set up, has predictable costs, and produces lots of recurring revenue.
