Clouds can be light and fluffy. They can also be&amp;hellip; not.
One massive convenience (and source of lock in) offered by major tech players is Cloud Storage. Its a big deal because its (relatively) easy to set up, has predictable costs, and produces lots of recurring revenue.
In this first dive into personal data ownership, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through setting up and using an open-source alternative to offerings like Dropbox and iCloud: Syncthing.</description></item><item><title>Owning Your Data: Prolog</title><link>https://www.quentb.com/posts/own-data-intro/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 22:23:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.quentb.com/posts/own-data-intro/</guid><description>I used to be a huge fan of Google&amp;rsquo;s product offering. I started using Google Chrome around version 2, in 2009 &amp;ndash; before it had added support for extensions, themes, or syncing between devices through your Google Account.

Blog Randall Munroe, among others, has noted the chronic problem of content producers who can&amp;rsquo;t commit. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to try and promise I&amp;rsquo;ll post a lot, or even that this blog won&amp;rsquo;t go stale, disappear, and maybe be replaced by yet another in 2 years &amp;ndash; history shows this is likely.

Have you ever stopped to consider how much we put behind locks? The past 48 hours has been nothing but that thought running through my mind.
I normally like airports. I always have had an affinity to these massive buildings designed for such a singular goal: take as many humans as possible, with all their accoutrements, put them on airplanes and send them off.</description></item><item><title>Review: Architecture of Happiness</title><link>https://www.quentb.com/old_blog/arch-of-happiness-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.quentb.com/old_blog/arch-of-happiness-review/</guid><description>Nota bene: This is a post manually carried forward from an older iteration of my blog.
