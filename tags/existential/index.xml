&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I feel a strong sense of meaning and fulfillment when I can communicate an Idea I genuinely believe in to an audience. Probably the strongest moment of that was my high school graduation, speaking to an audience of 500 classmates and thousands of friends and family in an arena.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="Ivepeakedlol.jpg" alt="I cleaned up pretty good in 2015">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More recently, I have been showered with worldly blessings. I have a great job doing interesting things and with wonderful people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And on April 5, 2022, I became acutely aware that I am going to die someday, and none of it mattered at all to me any more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried my usual ways of getting absolution, I wrote Bible verses (Galatians) on my whiteboard and read Max Lucado books. I feel into a deep nihilism, and the Bible quote turned to Nietzsche.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In early June, I erased my whiteboard and simply wrote a question mark. And for some reason I drew a heart around it, and that&amp;rsquo;s what has remained since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="HeartQuestion.png" alt="A question mark encircled by a heart">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had my college roommates over for a Saturday evening, we played games and drank and joked about one of them and his upcoming wedding. The betrothed left early (long drive home) and the remaining friend and I wandered outside and started talking about whatever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we kept talking until nearly midnight, 4 hours of back and forth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His central question mirrored mine: by all likelihood, we are destined to lead mediocre lives. He was stating it as a fact. And he was afraid that he would become &lt;em>okay with it.&lt;/em> I wish I could have given him some of the weird, beyond-words ideas that had been percolating in my head for months at this point, but I could only halfheartedly ramble on and on, trying to explain but failing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to communicate things that I have found to be deeply true, but the ideas and feelings and concepts I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to ponder are refusing to yield to language, because at some level they are too big. Rationality has failed me. It began its death in 2016, I think, and I buried it this June. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;ve run to &lt;em>ir&lt;/em>rationality (or at least, I&amp;rsquo;ve tricked myself into thinking I haven&amp;rsquo;t)&amp;hellip; rather, some sort of trans-rationality. I&amp;rsquo;m walking what Robert Persig calls &amp;ldquo;the high country of the mind&amp;rdquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting a headache because I haven&amp;rsquo;t acclimated to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m so alone right now. The few people that I feel understand, or at least tolerate, my thinking have limited time and I feel I can only go to them so often before they too get fed up and really lock me out. I desperately wish I could know who was safe to talk to, I need a shibboleth, a secret signal, to identify them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My church has become alien, hard, and alarmingly cold. I desperately need my God, but the thought of entering his house makes me feel uncomfortable, even physically ill. I love the people of my home church, but will they still love me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I walked through downtown after work for two hours today, reading and pondering. The church on Hope&amp;rsquo;s campus was open, and I walked inside, looking for god. The main sanctuary was dark and empty, and I did not find God there. I walked into a small room below, and saw three nondescript wood panels in a wall. Was this where the church kept God? I said this tongue-in-cheek, of course: I don&amp;rsquo;t really believe the trinity is stored behind three wooden panels in a church basement in West Michigan, but for a moment I genuinely wished it were so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="TheTrinity.png" alt="Three wooden panels">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote in my journal earlier in the walk, thinking about wind and air.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On a clear summer day, you cannot see the wind at all. When I think of my mental connections to wind, I see an old painting of an anthropomorphized cloud, lips pursed, blowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the paintings there&amp;rsquo;s always these wavy lines and white or gray substance to show us the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But as I look at the trees right now, you cannot see anything affecting them. You only see the wind in the bending and thrashing of the leaves and branches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also feel the wind, and you hear it. But you cannot see it at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On one level: &lt;em>duh&lt;/em>. But Seriously, try and look &lt;strong>at&lt;/strong> wind, or air, on a clear warm day. Not the shimmer of heat, or the movement of leaves, or clouds&amp;ndash;look at the AIR ITSELF.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>God feels like that to me right now. She&amp;rsquo;s everywhere, They permeate existence and are as necessary to us as the air we breath. But you cannot directly look at Him. Maybe, in the same way that if air was opaque we would not be able to see anything else, God has hidden from us on a material level because it would overpower our senses otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what I&amp;rsquo;m starting to believe about meaning &amp;ndash; in the grand sense. Trying to take in a grand universal understanding of meaning would be like trying to hug a semi truck barreling down on you. The way I see it, we can think just enough to be dangerous to ourselves. Life has no meaning in so far as there is no meaning that is understandable to the fucking 2 HP putt-putt engine we have to traverse a highway called metaphysics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Picasso used to carry a revolver loaded with blanks that he&amp;rsquo;d fire at people who ask him what his work meant. God carries a handful of neuroses and existential dread that he wads up into spitballs and fires into the ears of philosophers that get too big for their britches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So WHAT NOW? How do I comfort my friend, afraid of a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; life. How do I convince him, and in a deeper way, myself, that this delicious moment of our consciousness is not some generally beige-colored march to the grave that we occasionally dip below into depression or jump above into happiness? I crave a concrete platform to build on, because I am all too aware now that my house was built upon the sand, as Jesus warned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The CRC seemed to impart a sense of certainty. But the results of that certainty: predestination, limited atonement, and the declaration of same-sex relations as an abomination now elevated to confessional status, I find this certainty to be an incarnation of hell itself to me. If I continue to dwell in it, I genuinely feel like I&amp;rsquo;m in torment. It provokes a physical reaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who do I go to?
What now?
When will I feel normal, and be able to just live life again?
Where are my words?
&lt;em>Why&lt;/em> is this so confusing!?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do I continue?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Chasm</title><link>https://www.quentb.com/posts/the-chasm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 21:48:39 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://www.quentb.com/posts/the-chasm/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was reading a curious story on Wednesday. It was the story and final recollections of a man suffering from advanced ALS. He ultimately made the personal decision to die via medical assistance. ALS is a terrifying way to go, and I felt moved as I read it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some reason, I found his twitter feed. As I looked at the final post written by the man (his family wrote some more tweets after his passing), a terrifying thought gripped me: I am going to also die someday. Its unavoidable, as much a part of life as birth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think we all sort-of have a vague understanding in the back of our minds that it must happen. We causally think about retirement one day, we sit down and write wills, we imagine a far future that we implicitly know we will not be a part of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That night, for some reason, it struck me in a deep way I&amp;rsquo;d never felt in my life before. It hammered down my spine, left me feeling clammy, alone, and terrified.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My fight-or-flight response saw my end, and did its job. Historically, that vision would be a bit more immediate and avoidable: a stalking tiger, a roaring bear. The death that is &amp;ldquo;acute&amp;rdquo; in a sense, a fate that if you, just for a moment, push all you have into your legs, process all incoming information in a hyper-focused manner, disposing any extraneous information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which is very useful for 2-5 minutes. But I was in this mode, off and on, for almost 72 hours. The tingling chill turns into a vague clamminess, the hyper-focus makes it impossible to let go of the terrorizing idea, which haunts you like a spectre. You sleep fitfully, wake up early, and probably have nightmares.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its at this moment that everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind is going to go a different route.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="leaving-the-faith-like-losing-a-friend" >Leaving the Faith like losing a friend
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#leaving-the-faith-like-losing-a-friend">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Its one thing for a Christian to leave the faith in a single, active moment. I genuinely respect these people, though I do mourn their decision. The thing is, that almost never happens in practice. Speaking from experience, I see most ex-Christians realizing their status after they&amp;rsquo;ve long made the practical changes. Church visits stop, prayer grows superficial, loses its connection and becomes mere words, which soon enough ceases outside of the occasional performant act done in the presence of others who you still need to &amp;ldquo;keep up appearances&amp;rdquo; for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You start to adjust your worldview, and the zeitgeist soaks into your brain. Religion is outdated &amp;ndash; it was useful when humans were first figuring things out, because it was a good story that encouraged reproduction and cooperation in a way that meant religious out-competed the non-religious, meaning that it was selected for as a result of long-term evolutionary pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s what the thinkers of the day say, at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in the moment of terror, that is a cold comfort. Secular learning channel Kurtzgesagt expresses the worldview people fall into in this mode, called &amp;ldquo;Optimistic Nihilism&amp;rdquo;. Basically, yeah, this is what it is, might as well make the best of it. The ultimate answer to the question, &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;, is simply, &amp;ldquo;well, why not?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works pretty well, day-to-day. Its quite freeing, in many ways. There&amp;rsquo;s no point, no morality, so live however you want! I personally found this a relief because of my personal struggle with pornography. If there&amp;rsquo;s no morality, the only reason porn is bad is that its evolutionarily counter to reproduction. And who cares about that? Why should we?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It ironically made it easy for me to fall into a cycle of chemical anesthesia, an inoculation against the infinite chasm that lurked in the corner of my mind. And a lot of very smart people have laid out some very, very excellent arguments in favor of it. After all, it is a &amp;ldquo;complete&amp;rdquo; explanation requiring no faith.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-doubt-of-my-doubt" >The Doubt of my Doubt
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-doubt-of-my-doubt">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But I realized, that isn&amp;rsquo;t true. The secular zeitgeist does have assumptions, but they&amp;rsquo;re sort of stated casually and cast aside. Namely, it sneers at the idea that anything is truly unknowable. The implied belief is that anything we don&amp;rsquo;t know is a hole that just needs to be penciled in. Anything but the most pessimistic view has a faith of its own. See, for example, Issac Asimov&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Final Question&amp;rdquo;. It offers a hope for a future that somehow extends beyond the heat death of the universe. Or any sci-fi with faster-than-light travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These hopeful stories, popular anchors of the communities I frequented, were sources of hope for those that abandoned the old hopes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I began to wonder, if I had walked away from my faith upbringing because it ultimately relied on a trust that cannot be verified by us in our current state&amp;hellip; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I also reject these futures?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was left was terribly bleak. I&amp;rsquo;d argue that any truly, fully-committed ex-theist that left the faith because of this &amp;ldquo;leap of faith&amp;rdquo;, must be either internally inconsistent, or depressed to the point of apathy, maybe even suicidal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-re-kindling" >The re-kindling
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-re-kindling">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, after two days of cold, fretful, desperate flailing, I reached out for a ridiculous hope. I pulled open my beside drawer and extracted the dusty, forgotten study bible given to me in High School.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mentally berated myself for my weakness. &lt;em>All the other ex-theists have faced this terror and weathered the storm, yet you go back to fairytales. You clearly aren&amp;rsquo;t smart enough.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em>really&lt;/em> it. I found myself probing that thought deeper, ironically, following the rationalist impulse and cognitive behavioral therapy training I knew. Come on; not being smart enough? Intelligence has nothing to do with this primal fear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>If you do this, you will be putting yourself on the side of the terrible, simple-minded bigots. The ones that voted for politicians that want to persecute people like you and your friends for your sexual orientation. You &lt;strong>traitor&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was a more serious wall. Its true, the election of Donald Trump, and the populist movement that seemed to coast on the rails of the modern evangelical apparatus, is something that deeply troubles me. But I knew from my days of believing in college that I had already found a faith clearly described by the Bible which did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> match what I saw on cable news. That was a problem, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the issue of the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Fine. You personally may not be part of that group, but the groups of friends you now hang out with? They won&amp;rsquo;t know that. They will&lt;/em> &lt;strong>reject&lt;/strong> &lt;em>you&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is closer to the truth yet. But there was another level to this; I had a childhood that unfortunately made me very experienced with rejection, and I knew how to move on, and not value myself purely by the external beliefs of those around me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shivering in the fetal position, I knew my answer: &lt;em>You have always believed. It was just easier to justify your sin by papering over that belief.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well&amp;hellip; crap. Now I&amp;rsquo;m terrified &lt;em>and&lt;/em> ashamed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I cried out a desperate, sobbing prayer. &amp;ldquo;Please, God. Just take away this fear. Please, give me peace so I can sleep. Please&amp;hellip; forgive me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I felt utterly, desolately alone. I would never pretend to fully understand the abandonment Christ felt on the cross, but I think I had just the slightest taste. I believed I had left God, and in turn, God had left me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-lie" >The Lie
&lt;span>
&lt;a href="#the-lie">
&lt;svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">&lt;path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"/>&lt;/svg>
&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This, my friends, is a form of the terrible lie told to us by the evils of this world. It seduces us with what seems like a free life, a life where you are unburdened by &amp;ldquo;outdated ancient customs&amp;rdquo; that was the source of all war, the justification of prejudice, the hand-wave that allowed atrocities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you follow that happy lie, away and away from the path you once walked, focused on a portrait of a world happier and freer that the one you have forced yourself into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then the portrait is smashed, and you see you are inches from stepping off the edge of a cliff into an infinite chasm of death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that dark moment, the lie is nearly complete in its snare. It suddenly swaps, going from the sweet song encouraging you forward to the dark, laughter that now bars your retreat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You did this. You have no right to return. God watched you walk away, and any possible path back will be arduous and strict. You might find a lesser sort of salvation - if you don&amp;rsquo;t make a mistake ever again.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friends. This is so untrue its laughable in context. God and his prophets knew this was the core lie, and therefore left us many stories countering this. The history of the Israelites is one of God raising up his chosen people, the people walking away, abandoning God, then being brought back to his fold. Over, and over, and over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesus, tells us the parable of the prodigal son, who demands his inheritance and squanders it, and crawls back hoping to live as a slave in his father&amp;rsquo;s estate. The father, of course, &lt;em>runs&lt;/em> out to his son upon seeing him, has him dressed in fine clothes and jewelry, and plans a feast of celebration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesus himself, after his closest friends on Earth abandoned him wholesale in the darkest moment of creation, even denying their association to him multiple times, returned to them, greeted them as friends, and rights their wrongs, empowering the apostles to go on and grow the early church with fearless courage.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I had made this mental journey, but I still feel the physical aftershocks. Looking back, I find myself noting a moment in retrospect, when the terror stopped being &lt;em>my&lt;/em> terror. This was the terror of something inside me that had taken root, and realized it had been found and revealed, and was to be cast out, totally powerless to act.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scared-but-hopeful" >Scared, but hopeful

&lt;/a>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So I&amp;rsquo;m still washing the waves of terror off as I write this. But I had already been given hope, even before I knew to ask. Shivering, terrified, I asked for forgiveness, and I asked for peace. I also asked for a friend. I was so tired, so afraid. I asked God to send someone to reach out to me in that moment because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to do so myself. This was sometime after midnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I eventually fell into a restless sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I woke up, and the terror was gone for a moment, but began to descend again quickly. I reached to my phone as a distraction. A text had come in the night before, around 11:30 PM. My friend and college roommate, who hadn&amp;rsquo;t talked to me in six months, had sent me a text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hey, we should hang out. A lot has happened in my life, and I want to catch up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>God has answers to our prayers before we know to ask them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
