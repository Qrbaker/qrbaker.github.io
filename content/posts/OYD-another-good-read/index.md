Just a quick shout-out to a fantastic write-up on making your own "cloud". This reflects a lot of my beliefs, and takes my suggestions a step further from using enterprise storage; showing how to run a cloud on your own virtual instances.

This is much more business-oriented, but has plenty of pearls to be found in the text. Fair warning: it includes lots of jargon.
