I don’t know if anyone in the history of written language has ever, on their own volition, gone out to a bookstore and
bought themselves a book of Haikus. I know I haven’t. In my case, I received [_Haiku in English: The first Hundred
Years_](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00AR3558C&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_KaFpAb7V3247S)
as a Christmas present a few years ago and only then because my parents knew one of the Editors, Mr. Allan Burns. That
said, when I decided to pick up this book out of boredom and flip through it, I found myself surprised at the
cohesiveness, varied selection, and overall enjoyment factor this book contained.

The Editors in their foreword note that they sought to introduce a novice haiku reader (that’s what, 99.99% of the
population?) to the evolution and accomplishments of Haiku over the past 100 years. This means a couple of things:
First, that the authors are not listed in alphabetical order, but rather loosely chronologically. The editors also
purposefully start with more traditional examples of a haiku, for example, a selection from Richard Wright:

> The sudden thunder  
> Startles the Magnolias   
> To a deeper white.  

But then quickly move to more abstract, loosely haiku-form poems, or even “eye-kus”, visually short poems that seek to
achieve the same result as a standard three-line version. I personally found the following from Shawn McMurtagh to be a
good example:

The poems range from serious to silly; deeply distilled to seemingly spur-of-the moment. Jack Kerouac has an almost
irreverent contribution:

> Missing a kick  
> at the icebox door  
> It closed anyway

And Nick Virgilio has a real gut-punch:

> the sack of kittens  
> sinking in the icy creek  
> increases the cold

The poems can jump from one of these states to the other, giving the reader mental whiplash. Then again, perhaps that’s
the point.

The last third or so of the book is devoted to notes and credits, but a short overview of English haikus is also
included here. After finishing with a Haiku from Rebecca Lilly (Snow at dawn… / dead singers in their prime / on the
radio), the editors chose to include a short haiku primer. It starts by noting that, as with so much of our western
borrowed culture, we got the name wrong! Haiku actually comes from the Japanese _hokku_, which itself is merely a small
part of a larger collaborative poem style called _renga_. With those nitpicks out of the way, a brief coverage of the
formation of the English style commences, including why we have the most common 5-7-5 syllable structure.

Immediately after this primer is a brief history of the English haiku. Initially, it began with translations of existing
Japanese poems, meaning the West’s first exposure to Haikus was not at the hand of poets, but scholars. Many translators
and scholars started by attempting to bring the original structure and flow of the Japanese poems to English, with
varying success. Finally, Yone Noguchi wrote the first confirmed original English haiku in 1902:

> Tell me the street to Heaven.  
> This? Or that? Oh, which?  
> What webs of streets!

The rest of the history is legitimately interesting and varied, and notes the fingerprints of several generations on the
decidedly different form of the modern English haiku from its Japanese ancestor. Each new group of authors and poets
found the form and left their mark on it. From the first wave, to the “beats” at the end of the ‘30s, and on to the
proliferation of Haiku journals and societies that codified certain aspects of the Haiku, the short form takes on a
complex set of historical overtones, almost as if the form were a fine wine or a particularly stinky aged cheese.

I admit, I did not think this book would be enjoyable. I picked it up expecting a read-through that would be
invigorating as Webster’s New World Dictionary. However, by the end of my journey through this small Anthology, I had a
changed opinion. The poems are genuinely interesting, often thought-provoking, and occasionally could move me to
emotion. Jim Kacian, Philip Rowland, and Allan Burns have produced a wonderful and elegant foray into a world of poetry
I expect most English readers don’t know exist. To sum up:

> Haiku in English  
> Brought from Eastern History  
> Now in Western Clothes.
